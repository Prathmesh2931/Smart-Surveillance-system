# **AI-Based Surveillance System**

An intelligent surveillance solution using **LLaVA-7B**, built for both **pre-recorded** and **live webcam** feeds. The system analyzes visual input, detects abnormal or violent behavior, and sends **real-time alerts via Telegram**, along with storing all flagged data in **MongoDB Atlas**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Features**

- üß† **LLaVA-7B-based Vision-to-Text Analysis**
- üé• Pre-recorded video frame analysis
- üì° Real-time surveillance via phone/webcam (IP stream)
- üì¨ Telegram Bot Alerts (triggered only on detected violence/anomaly)
- üóÉÔ∏è MongoDB Atlas for storing frame data, timestamps, and captions

---

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üì• **Model Requirement**

Download and set up the **LLaVA-7B model** using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/llava).  
Once setup is complete, make sure the model is accessible via:

```bash
ollama run llava
```

---

## üß™ **1. Pre-recorded Video Analysis**

Run the Jupyter notebook for analyzing a recorded video:

```bash
jupyter notebook llava_prevideo.ipynb
```

### What It Does:
- Extracts frames at every 30-frame interval
- Sends each frame to **Model** for caption generation
- Stores results in **MongoDB Atlas**
- Triggers **Telegram alert only** if a frame contains violence or anomaly

#### üì∏ Example Outputs:
- Processed frame 
> ![Violence](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a1195f-1ca4-44d3-8428-e23e8bff7707)
- Output Provided By Model

## üî¥ **2. Live Webcam Surveillance**

Run the live surveillance script using:

```bash
python llava_multi.py
```

### What It Does:
- Captures frames from live webcam (can use phone camera via IP)
- Sends them to **Model** for real-time analysis
- If violence/anomaly is detected:
  - Triggers **Telegram alert**
  - Includes **frame description**, **timestamp**, and **IP-based location**
- Saves flagged frames and captions to **MongoDB Atlas**

#### üì∏ Example Outputs:
- Live flagged frame
